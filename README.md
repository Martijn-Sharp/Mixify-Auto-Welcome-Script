# Mixify Auto Welcome Script
This script can be used on Mixify.com while streaming your DJ set. The main reason why I created this script is that I couldn't see every single person who enters the stream so I thought it could be nice if script can annonce in chat who entered the stream with a warm welcome message.

To compile the typescript file, use http://www.typescriptlang.org/Playground if you're unable to do it otherwise.
Copy the whole content of the MixifyAutoWelcome.ts file into the left box.
